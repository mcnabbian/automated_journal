# Automated Journal
The goal of this project is to create a script which automatically sends me a form to fill out asking me about my day.
The idea is that this will teach me valuable skills about how to start, map out, build, and eventually complete a
personal project. It will also, once completed, encourage me to write out my thoughts about the day and conveniently
store them, creating a log that I can reflect on over time.

I will break this project down into the following steps:
1. Write a program that I can run and send an automated email.
2. Get that email to send everyday at the same time.
3. Format that message with relevant language.. HTML?
4. Save replies to database/file.
5. I will then modify the program to send a message to my desktop using a GUI.
6. Continue to save replies/entries into database/file.
7. Send desktop push notifications.
8. Create a mobile app.
9. Ensure sending of daily push notifications.
10. Synchronise entries between desktop app and mobile app.
